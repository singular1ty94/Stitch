##Stitch
###Steam With Twitch


A cloud mashup of Steam, Twitch and IGN Reviews.

You can find the Code Documentation in `/doc/`, generated by [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org).

A live version is available on [Heroku](http://stitch-steam-with-twitch.herokuapp.com/).

###Running the App
The app runs using NodeJS. You can find the latest version [here](http://nodejs.org/).

First, you'll need to install the dependencies. Open a terminal to `/Stitch/` and run `npm install`.

To start the app, run `node server.js` and navigate to (by default) `localhost:8888`.

Docs are found at `localhost:8888/docs/index.html` or in the `/docs/` folder.

Known to work on the latest versions of Firefox and Chrome.

###User Guide.
You can use the app by selecting a PC Game on the left hand side of the screen. 

On the right, you can Launch the game via Steam (assuming Steam is installed and you own the game).

You can view Twitch videos and play them by clicking the previews - sometimes people might not be streaming. 
Twitch can be quite slow sometimes, so please be patient!

###Explore the Code.
If you're viewing this from the `/doc/` folder, you can navigate the fully-documented code, much like you would with JavaDoc.

The app is seperated into two main chunks, the `Core` client-side code, and the `Server` server-side code.


---

###Configuration
You can configure some paramters in the file `/etc/config.js`. 

The settings are self-explanatory, but please take care editing the file.
